## **Tic-Tac-NO!!**
Its like tic-tac-toe but instead of choosing where to tic( or tac or toe? ) you choose where not to
and the game chooses randomly among the available squares except the choosen one.

After completing "your first 2d game" tutorial on godot docs I wanted to so something without following instructions/tutorials so I thought of tic-tac-toe but with a twist.

This project covers basics of godot's workflow for beginner(I think) with stuff like HUD, signals etc
